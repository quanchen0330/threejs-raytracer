# threejs-raytracer
This is an application for drawing realistic scenes specified by our proprietary JSON format using the THREE.js library.
The first part of the project implemented sphere/triangle intersection, Phong ambient, diffuse and specular illumination, basic shading, and reflections. To give each scene a more realistic look, I implemented three extensions. First, by default each shape has a very jagged outline: at the expense of rendering time, we can smoothen it via regular sampling antialiasing at each pixel. Shading of a particular pixel was determined by whether it was in shadow, but now we are determining the appropriate darkness of shading for each. Finally, at first the entire scene was "in focus" but by manipulating the eye and direction vectors parts of the scene can appear in focus at a particular depth.
